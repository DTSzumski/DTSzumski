- 👋 Hi, I’m @DTSzumski
- 👀 I’m interested in making documenteries informative educational videos 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that I know nothing about code or really care to learn
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on I need help TTS I have voices need to put in app offline for my use I stuff voices in app I know not work need code put in right not me put code in add voices I don't do code I know enough to know needs to be done right. I want my databases to be able to convert the text to speech to answer and understand speech to text and carry out commands. I want to verbaly interface with my databases. This is completely out of realm of knowledge. My databases basically a record is a day every field a calculation and the coresponding text to express that data. I can render that data in text form in comprehendable sentances my conundrum is turing it into speech. I can convert it to speech that is not a problem. I don't want to take parts then convert I want it free flowing this is the disconnect between what I can do and what I want to do. To some I know this is very simple to me it is a brick wall it is beyond my capabilities of have a basic understanding of how it can and is done
